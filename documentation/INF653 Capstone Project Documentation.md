## I. Installation Instructions

1. Ensure you have Java 17 or later installed on your system.

3. Install PostgreSQL and set it up â€“ there should be two tables created using the following commands:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- hashed password
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Tasks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    userId INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (userId) REFERENCES Users(id)
);
```

4. Clone the repository to your local machine and open the IDE of your choice (Eclipse or IntelliJ recommended).

5. Navigate to the project directory and run `mvnw clean install` to build the project.

## II. Application Properties Setup

The application uses a properties file for configuration. You can find this file at `src/main/resources/application.properties`. Update this file with your specific database login details.

<br>

---

## III. Usage Guidelines

To start the application, navigate to the project directory and run `mvnw spring-boot:run`. The application will start and by default can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080`.

<br>

---

## IV. Architecture and Design Decisions

The application is built using the Spring Boot framework, which provides a robust and flexible foundation for developing Java applications. The entry point of the application is the `TaskManagerApplication` class.

The application follows a typical MVC architecture with User and Task entities, UserService and TaskService services, and controllers.

The `UserService` and `TaskService` classes in `task_manager/service/` are examples of service classes that handle business logic related to User and Task entities respectively.

The application uses Thymeleaf for server-side rendering of HTML. An example of a Thymeleaf template can be found at `src/main/resources/templates/home.html`.
